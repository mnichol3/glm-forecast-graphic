This Python project recreates the tropical cyclone intensity forecasting graphic aid purposed by Stevenson et al. in their 2017 paper cited below:

Stevenson, Stephanie N., et al. “A 10-Year Survey of Tropical Cyclone Inner-Core Lightning Bursts and Their Relationship to Intensity     Change.” Weather and Forecasting, vol. 33, no. 1, Feb. 2018, pp. 23–36., doi:10.1175/waf-d-17-0096.1.

Written in Python 3.6

These scripts incorporate data from GOES-16 ABI & GLM instruments and Vortex Data Message (VDM) & TEMP DROP aircraft observations. ABI & GLM data is downloaded from NOAA's GOES-16 Amazon AWS bucket. Aircraft observations are obtained from the National Hurricane Center's data server.
